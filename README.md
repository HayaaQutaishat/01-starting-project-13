# Redux-Toolkit-React-App


### Project purpose :

In this web application I handled some asynchronous tasks with Redux Toolkit (Dending HTTP requests and similar tasks), also in this project I used Redux DevTools to inspect and debug my Redux store. 
Redux DevTools allows me to view the current state of the store, dispatch actions, and see the changes to the state that result from those actions.
